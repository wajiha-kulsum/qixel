> Add animated React components to your project with one command.

A shadcn-style CLI tool that copies animated components directly into your React project. You own the code, you customize it.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @wajiha12/qixel-cli

# Or use with npx (no installation)
npx @wajiha12/qixel-cli init
npx @wajiha12/qixel-cli add magnetic-button
```

---

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Global Installation (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @wajiha12/qixel-cli
```

Then use anywhere:

```bash
qixel init
qixel list
qixel add magnetic-button
```

### Option 2: Use with npx (No Installation)

```bash
npx @wajiha12/qixel-cli init
npx @wajiha12/qixel-cli list
npx @wajiha12/qixel-cli add magnetic-button
```

---

## 🎯 Usage

### 1. Initialize Your Project

```bash
qixel init
```

This creates a `qixel.json` config file in your project.

### 2. List Available Components

```bash
qixel list
```

See all available animated components.

### 3. Add Components

```bash
qixel add magnetic-button
```

This will:
- ✅ Copy the component source to your project
- ✅ Automatically install required dependencies (framer-motion, etc.)
- ✅ Place it in your configured components directory

### 4. Use in Your App

```tsx
import { MagneticButton } from '@/components/qixel/buttons/magnetic-button'

function App() {
  return <MagneticButton>Click me!</MagneticButton>
}
```

---

## 🎨 Available Components

### Buttons
- **magnetic-button** - Button that subtly follows the cursor for a magnetic feel

*More components coming soon!*

## 💡 Philosophy (Shadcn-style)

Like shadcn/ui, Qixel components are:

- ✅ **Copy-pasted directly into your project** (you own the code)
- ✅ **Fully customizable** (modify as you wish)
- ✅ **No package dependency** (not a component library)
- ✅ **TypeScript ready** (fully typed)
